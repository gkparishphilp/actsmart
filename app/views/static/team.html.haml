				Why is the ACT SMART toolkit important?
			%p
				My goal is to develop a toolkit that builds the strengths of community agencies toprovide research-based treatments to individuals with autism. It is also critically important that the toolkit be easy to use, relevant, and cost-effective for agencies. It is my aim for the ACT SMART toolkit to meet these goals. 

			%p
				Iâ€™m excited to be working closely with community agencies caring for individuals with autism to share what we have developed and learn more about how to best use the ACT SMART toolkit.

				Why is the ACT SMART toolkit important?
			%p
				As a former direct provider in an ASD community agency, I am strongly invested in

				the improvement of outcomes for individuals with autism. I believe the ACT SMART 

				toolkit has the potential to improve client outcomes through assisting community 

				agencies in identifying and implementing a research-based treatment that best suits 

				their needs. I look forward to the valuable insight that will be gained through testing 

				the ACT SMART toolkit in ASD community agencies.

				Why is the ACT SMART toolkit important?
			%p
				The ACT SMART toolkit has been designed be used flexibly to meet the needs

				of community-based agencies providing services for individuals with Autism 

				Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I believe the toolkit will assist agencies in identifying 

				and implementing evidence-based interventions for individuals with ASD and 

				their families, and develop strategies for their sustained use. I am excited at the 

				opportunity to build and foster relationships with community agencies and gain 

				increased awareness on how best to support agencies at implementing evidence-
				based interventions.
