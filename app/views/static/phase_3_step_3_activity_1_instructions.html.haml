				%ul.none
					%li a.	<b>Use currently:</b> This strategy is currently being used within your agency with success.
					%li b.	<b>Previous success:</b> This strategy has been used in the past to successfully implement and/or sustain new treatments.
					%li c.	<b>Feasible:</b> This strategy will be feasible (compatible, practical) for use within your agency.

				4) <b>Identify the most supported strategy or set of strategies.</b> Use the information gathered as you considered each strategy to determine which strategy or set of strategies will be most successful to support the initial implementation and sustained use of the research-based treatment.
			%p
				5)	<b>Plan for strategy use.</b> Once the specific strategy or set of strategies has been identified, detail how the strategy will be carried out. For instance, if you select Conduct local consensus discussions, this may be carried out by holding discussions at staff meetings to reach consensus on implementation decisions. Finally, specify who will carry out this plan.
