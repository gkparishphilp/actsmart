				Step 1. Develop the Adaptation Plan

				<u>Goals</u>: To identify the types of adaptations needed and develop a plan to perform specific adaptations to the research-based treatment.

				Introduction

			%p
				Even though a treatment has demonstrated
				%a{ href: '/glossary#efficacy' }
					efficacy 
				and 
				%a{ href: '/glossary#effectiveness' }
					effectiveness 

				in the research literature, it may still need to be
				%a{ href: '/glossary#adapt' }
					adapted 
				before it can be used at your agency.

				<b>Core elements</b> of a treatment are the specific strategies or techniques that are responsible for a treatment’s effectiveness. When making adaptation decisions, it is critical not to impact the core elements of a treatment.

				When making adaptation decisions, it is critical not to impact the core elements of the treatment. These are the specific strategies or techniques that are responsible for a treatment’s effectiveness. To avoid unintentional problems, treatment adaptations should be carefully planned and carried out. 
			%p
				The goal of this step is to systematically evaluate whether adaptations are needed for the research-based treatment your agency will implement, and to develop a plan to perform necessary adaptations.

				A planning worksheet to specify what adaptations are going to be done, reasons for the adaptation, considerations for effectiveness and who will be making the changes.
