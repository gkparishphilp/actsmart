				The purpose of Step 2 is to synthesize the information previously collected. After combining and analyzing all of the responses, the ACT SMART team will provide a summary of the information, identifying areas of strength, areas in need of growth, recommendations for next steps, and an overall summary indicating your agency’s receptivity to adding a new treatment. Additionally, the ACT SMART team will lead feedback sessions to present the summary, gather staff perspectives about the findings, and assist with prioritizing needs.
