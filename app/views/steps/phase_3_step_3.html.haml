				Step 3. Develop the Implementation and Sustainment Plan
			%p
				<u>Goal</u>: To select specific implementation and sustainment strategies that will support the initial and ongoing use of the research-based treatment, and develop a plan for using the selected strategies.
			%h4
				Introduction

			%p
				Passive implementation efforts often lead to limited implementation or discontinuation of a research-based treatment. Therefore, many evidence-based strategies have been developed to support the successful implementation and sustained use of research-based treatments. These strategies vary greatly in their level of involvement, time commitment, and cost. 
			%p
				This Implementation and Sustainment Plan worksheet is designed to assist your implementation team in selecting which strategy or set of strategies is most feasible for your agency to use, and specify how these strategies will be used throughout your agency.

						What is Initial Implementation?
				%p
					The process of putting to use or integrating evidence-based interventions within a setting (National Institutes of Health, 2011).
				%center
					%b
						What is Sustained Use?
				%p
					The (a) capacity to deliver and/or (b) core elements of an intervention is maintained (e.g., remain recognizable or delivered at a sufficient level of fidelity or intensity to yield desirable results) after initial implementation support has been withdrawn (Wiltsey Stirman et al., 2012).
