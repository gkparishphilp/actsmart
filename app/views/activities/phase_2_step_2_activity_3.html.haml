				<u>Goal</u>: Evaluate the clinical value and research validity of the treatment you are considering to adopt within your agency.

			%p
				There are a many treatments available for individuals with ASD. Treatments may vary in terms of their clinical value and/or research validity. To make the most informed choices about a new treatment, it is important to assess these factors before making a decision about adopting the treatment. The scores obtained from the clinical value and validity can be summed up to provide guidance for adopting a research-based treatment at your agency.

			%p
				<b>Clinical Value</b>: How meaningful and important the benefits and outcomes achieved by the treatment are to your agency, service providers, and clients served.

			%p
				<b>Research Validity</b>: The evidence supporting the use of the research-based treatment.
