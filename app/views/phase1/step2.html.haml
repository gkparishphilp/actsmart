				Introduction
			%p
				The purpose of the Receptivity to New Treatment Summary is to synthesize the information collected from the comprehensive Agency Assessment and the optional Caregiver/Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire. After combining and analyzing all of the responses, the ACT SMART team will provide a summary of the information, identifying areas of strength, areas in need of growth, recommendations for next steps, and an overall summary indicating your agencyâ€™s receptivity to adding a new treatment. Additionally, the ACT SMART team will lead several feedback sessions to present the summary, gather staff perspectives about the findings, and assist with prioritizing needs.
