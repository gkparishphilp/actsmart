              ACT SMART Phases and Steps
            </h2>
            <p>
              ACT SMART consists of four phases, with corresponding action steps that systematically guide agency leaders and teams toward successful identification, implementation and sustained use of a new research-based treatment. There is no set time to complete each phase or step; however, it is recommended that all of the steps be completed. The four phases include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Phase 1 – Identify Practice and Delivery Gaps:</b>
                The purpose of this phase is to identify an agency’s areas of strength and opportunities for growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Phase 2 – Treatment Selection and Adoption Decision:</b>
                During this phase, agency leaders and implementation teams identify potential research-based treatments and evaluate whether the treatment should be adopted within the agency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Phase 3 – Planning for Implementation:</b>
                The purpose of this phase is to guide the development of a training plan, treatment adaptation plan (if needed), and implementation and sustainment strategy plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Phase 4 – Implementation and Sustainment:</b>
                This phase tracks progress of the adaptation, training, implementation and sustainment plans, and provides guidance for overcoming common implementation obstacles that may arise.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
              ACT SMART Is…
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Comprehensive.</b>
                ACT SMART uses multiple strategies to guide agency leaders from evaluating agency needs through planning for treatment adaptation, staff training and implementation, and to using strategies to maintain treatment use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Systematic.</b>
                ACT SMART is comprised of four phases. Each phase has steps that facilitate progress within the phase and between phases. The systematic approach provides a structure and sequence to organize activities to implement new research-based treatments efficiently and effectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Research-based.</b>
                ACT SMART is comprised of research-based phases and steps that are designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of agencies to implement research-based treatments. The phases comprising ACT SMART (identify practice and delivery gaps, treatment selection and adoption decision, planning for implementation, and implementation with sustainment) have been studied using rigorous scientific methods in a variety of service settings (Brownson et al., 2012).

            <h2>
              ACT SMART Emphasizes…
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Building capacity within agencies.</b>
                Agency leaders receive training and ongoing facilitation for one year to support use of ACT SMART.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Individualization to meet agency needs.</b>
                ACT SMART allows for individualization and flexibility within a structured set of activities and phases. It guides agencies to identify and adopt any research-based treatment that may best fit their specific needs. Additionally, agencies can individualize targeted strategies to adapt treatments, train staff, and begin using the treatment. Finally, ACT SMART allows the agency to determine who will participate in decision-making, planning, and implementation activities.
              </li>

                <b>Fit and Feasibility with agencies.</b>
                Treatments must fit with the climate and culture of an agency to be successfully implemented and used over time. Additionally, the ease of implementing a treatment so that it can work well within the existing structure of an agency is critical for its success. ACT SMART assists agencies in evaluating the fit and feasibility of implementing a treatment in their agency to guide their adoption decision, planning and use of a treatment.

              Who Should Use ACT SMART?
            </h2>
            <p>
              ACT SMART was explicitly developed for use by community agencies providing services to individuals with ASD. It was designed for use among a variety of ASD providers, such as behavioral service providers, speech and language pathologists, and mental health service providers.

              Why was ACT SMART Developed?
            </h2>
            <p>
              This toolkit was developed to improve the process of implementing research-based treatments for individuals with ASD in community-based agencies. Our research and collaboration with community agency leaders suggests that most ASD community agencies do not have a systematic method for identifying treatment and training needs, matching research-based treatments to specific needs, or supporting initial training, implementation or sustained use over time. ASD community-based agencies play an integral role in addressing the developmental and behavioral problems, and core challenges that are common in ASD. Therefore, it is important that agencies have the tools necessary to efficiently and effectively implement research-based treatments.

              How was ACT SMART Developed?
            </h2>
            <p>
              ACT SMART was developed with funding from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) and in partnership with a team of community agency leaders (AMI Collaborative group). The AMI Collaborative group is comprised of 8 community providers delivering behavioral, speech and language, and mental health services to individuals with ASD, an implementation scientist, and several researchers. The AMI Collaborative group has met quarterly for a year and a half to develop the specific tools within this ACT SMART toolkit. Together, we integrated current procedures used by ASD community-based agencies to adopt and implement research-based treatments and available literature on implementation models and strategies to develop the ACT SMART materials.

              What is the ACT SMART toolkit?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The ACT SMART toolkit is a web-based, comprehensive toolkit developed for agencies that provide services to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ACT SMART assists Implementation Teams to successfully implement new research-based treatments throughout the agency. Specifically, the four phases of ACT SMART will:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Assists your agency’s Implementation Team to identify training and service delivery gaps and select research-based treatments to meet agency-wide needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Facilitate treatment adoption decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guide your agency’s Implementation Team to design effective training and use effective implementation strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Support efforts that will sustain the use of research-based treatments.
                </li>

            <h4 style='text-decoration:underline;'>
              What is the purpose of this study?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usefulness, and fidelity of the ACT SMART toolkit to determine whether it fits within your agency’s structure and helps to meet your agency’s needs.
            </p>
            <h4 style='text-decoration:underline;'>
              How will ACT SMART benefit my agency?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The ACT SMART toolkit aims to help your agency grow and meet the needs of your current and future clients. This toolkit will provide you with a comprehensive assessment of your agency’s areas of strengths and areas for growth, and provide recommendations for your agency. It will also provide structure for your agency evaluate whether a treatment should be adopted, provide planning tools related to adapting, training, and implementing a new research-based treatment, and support your agency as staff begin to use the treatment.
            </p>
            <h4 style='text-decoration:underline;'>
              How much time will ACT SMART really take?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We recommend that Implementation Teams spend at least 2 hours a month on ACT SMART web-based activities and an additional hour for the ACT SMART facilitation meetings (approximately 36 hours during the course of the year). However, the total amount of time that your agency’s Implementation Team spends on the ACT SMART activities will vary based on the number of members on the Implementation Team, how much planning is required, and the size of your agency. Research activities related to the study will take approximately 6½ hours throughout the year.

            <p>
              ACT SMART was developed to be flexible and fit with many different types of agency structures. We recommend identifying a specific person or team of people to complete the ACT SMART activities. This will help to ensure consistency and completion of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are different options for who can complete ACT SMART materials: 1) an agency leader or 2) an implementation team.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
                <u>
                  Agency leader.
                </u>
                Identify an agency leader who will be responsible for completing ACT SMART materials. This person should be the decision-maker in the agency. That is, this person should have the opportunity and independence to decide the specific treatments to implement within an agency. It is important that the person identified completes all ACT SMART materials for consistency in reporting. However, we suggest that the agency leader not work in total isolation from agency staff. Communicating with agency staff increases buy-in for the treatment that is identified and implemented throughout the agency.

              <li>
                <u>
                  Implementation Team.
                </u>
                Alternatively, an implementation team comprised of agency staff can be formed to complete ACT SMART materials. For this team format, it is recommended to have regularly-scheduled team meetings to discuss and complete materials. If this team format option is chosen, please see our “Tips to promote collaborative and successful implementation teams.”

            <ul>
              <li style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
                It is highly recommended to set aside a regularly scheduled day and time to complete and review ACT SMART materials. It is recommended that at least two hours per month be devoted to reading and completing ACT SMART materials.
              </li>
              <li style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
                Some of the ACT SMART materials are very brief whereas others are more time-consuming to complete. We are confident that the more time you put in to completing ACT SMART materials fully, the more information and feedback you will receive to make well-informed adoption decisions of research-based treatments.
              </li>
              <li style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
                It is important to identify key stakeholders at your agency (e.g., opinion leaders, innovators, etc.). These staff members have a lot of influence on staff perceptions, attitudes, and acceptance of new research-based treatments. Additionally, these staff members are the individuals who will be able to let you know the general consensus of your staff and barriers to be problem-solved during the implementation process.
              </li>
              <li style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
                Strategic planning in engaging agency staff at all levels in the ACT SMART process will promote staff buy-in of research-based treatments and promote a positive culture.

              <li>
                The implementation of any new treatment is as much a social process as it is a technical one. The services your agency providers are embedded in a social context that includes the direct provider, supervisor, agency leader, agency, and community. Successful implementation of a new treatment is a function of how well the social context complements and supports the objectives of the treatment (Glisson & Schoenwald, 2005).

For example, Phase 1 focuses on identifying practice and delivery gaps and provides information about an agency's receptivity for change. Phase 2 focuses on selecting a research-based treatment and guiding implementation teams through adoption decisions. Phase 3 focuses on planning for treatment use. Finally, Phase 4 tracks the implementation use and evaluates the progress within the agency.

              </a>

                Agency Assessment Feedback

              for information about implementation supports currently being used by your agency. Additionally, look over recommendations of implementation and sustainment strategies that were provided as they may fit well with your agency’s climate and culture. Even if your agency is not currently using some of these strategies, they may match really well with your agency so that they are easier and more effective for your implementation plan.

              4) <b>Identify the most supported strategy or set of strategies.</b> Use the information gathered as you considered each strategy to determine which strategy or set of strategies will be most successful to support the initial implementation and sustained use of the research-based treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              5)	<b>Plan for strategy use.</b> Once the specific strategy or set of strategies has been identified, detail how the strategy will be carried out. For instance, if you select Conduct local consensus discussions, this may be carried out by holding discussions at staff meetings to reach consensus on implementation decisions. Finally, specify who will carry out this plan.
